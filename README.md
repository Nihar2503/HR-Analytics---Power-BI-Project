I created a Dashboard to study and predict employee turnover (attrition), as well as analyze the factors that affect job performance, satisfaction, and career growth.

The source of this Document was from the institute where I did Data Analytics, i.e., ETLHive

The Key Uses for the Dashboard (could be) are as follows:

  1) Descriptive Analysis: Insights into which demographics or roles tend to have higher turnover rates, or which departments might have lower job satisfaction.

  2) Compensation Analysis: Analyzing salary data, salary hikes, and stock options to understand how compensation affects employee retention.

  3) Employee Engagement: Measuring the correlation between employee involvement in their job and their overall performance and satisfaction.

  4) Attrition Prediction: Develop machine learning models to identify employees who are at risk of leaving.

  5) Workforce Satisfaction: Analyze relationships between job satisfaction, environment satisfaction, and performance.

  6) Compensation vs. Performance: Explore how salary and benefits impact employee performance and longevity.
